# Moksha Chowdary Guntupalli
Hey, Everyone!

I'm Moksha Chowdary Guntupalli, currently pursuing Master's in Business Analytics and Information Systems at USF. I belong to Hyderabad, India. I worked as a Associate Software Engineer in India for 2 years at Accenture. In terms of familiarity with big data, I am excited to learn more about it. Although I haven't had any direct experience with it yet, I am anxious to learn its applications and possibilities through this course.
