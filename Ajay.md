# Ajay Srikar Medidi

Hello everyone,  
I'm Ajay Srikar Medidi, currently pursuing my master's in Business Analytics and Information Systems at the University of South Florida, Tampa. I have previously worked as a Data Engineer at Infosys, where I gained experience in ETL operations using Azure Data Factory. I have a strong passion for cricket and actively play for a club in Tampa. As I progress through my course, I aim to delve deeper into additional ideas and broaden my knowledge to become more valuable in the world of data.
